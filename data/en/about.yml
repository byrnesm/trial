  content : " Hello, my name is Matthew Byrnes. 
  I am currently a graduate student at the University of 
  Southern Mississippi studying Coastal Sciences. 
  I have a bachelors of science from Purdue Uiversity in West Lafayette, 
  Indiana (HAIL PURDUE!). My roots can be traced back to the hills of 
  southern Indiana where I spent most of my childhood fishing and playing 
  in small creeks and streams. This sparked a passion for the hidden  alien
  world that lies below the waters surface. In the early days this fascination 
  manifested in the form of a love for fishing. As I grew, so did the scope of
  my interest. Instead of just capturing fish I wanted to understand the world 
  they inhabited. This led me to a undergraduate degree in Fisheries and Aquatic 
  Sciences. During this time both my academic and fishing interests blossomed. I
  have been fortunate to explore fisheries from the upper peninsula of Michigan to
  the coasts of Costa Rica. The goal of this blog is to share my fishing 
  adventures with others while also providing 
  an academic perspective on fisheries.
